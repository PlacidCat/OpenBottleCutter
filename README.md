# Recycling PET bottles for 3D Printing filament
There are a number of home-brew solutions that can take PET/PETE plastic from beverage bottles; the general process is the same.
* A PET bottle is cut into a "ribbon" of a specific width
* The ribbon is heated and re-formed into a straw-like filament via a process called "pultrusion" or pulled extrusion. Done with the appropriately-sized ribbon and outlet nozzle diameter, the filament can be used in an inexpensive FDM 3D printer
* With an appropriate printing profile, this filament can be used to print "all the things."

A key element to this process is cutting a bottle into a ribbon. Some have used razor or utility blades wedged in washers to cut the ribbon. This, however, will dull with time and is not desirable around children.

An alternative, safer means of cutting the ribbon is to have two bearings, one overlapping another, to act as "rolling scissors" to cut the plastic bottle.

There are few options to purchase such devices and even fewer designs available online. The OBC is an effort to kick-start a solution that makes this design widely available while inviting improvement from the wider community.
